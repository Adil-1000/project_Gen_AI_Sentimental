# Sentiment Analysis of Feedback using UiPath RPA and Generative AI  

## Overview  
This project combines the power of **UiPath Robotic Process Automation (RPA)** with **Generative AI** to analyze customer feedback effectively. The solution automates the collection, processing, and sentiment analysis of feedback from various sources, enabling organizations to understand customer opinions and improve decision-making.  

## Key Features  
- **Feedback Collection:** Automated data retrieval from sources like emails, web forms, and Excel files using UiPath.  
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Leveraging Generative AI to classify feedback into positive, negative, or neutral categories.  
- **Scalability:** Designed to handle large volumes of feedback data efficiently.  
- **Actionable Insights:** Provides sentiment trends and summary statistics for better understanding.  

## Workflow  
1. **Data Extraction:**  
   UiPath bots extract feedback data from designated sources.  
2. **Preprocessing:**  
   Feedback is cleaned and structured for analysis.  
3. **Sentiment Analysis:**  
   Generative AI model analyzes the sentiment of each feedback entry.  
4. **Report Generation:**  
   Summarized results are presented in user-friendly formats (e.g., dashboards or CSV files).  

## Technology Stack  
- **UiPath Studio**: For building and managing RPA workflows.  
- **Generative AI APIs/Models**: For advanced sentiment analysis.  
- **Data Visualization**: Optional integration with tools like Power BI or Excel for report generation.
